## API Reference

queue-flow consists of a helper function and its methods for initially constructing a queue-flow object, and the default queue-flow consructor and its methods (privileged and prototypal).

### ``q`` Accessor/Constructor Helper

This is the only thing publicly exposed by the library.

{% highlight js %}
q([nameOrArray], [qType]) // returns: new Q([nameOrArray], [qType])
{% endhighlight %}

``nameOrArray`` is either a string or an Array object, or can be left undefined.

When a string, the string is used as the queue's name, which is either found in the set of named queues or is constructed on the spot and added to the set.

When an array, the array is used to populate the unnamed queue immediately, and the queue is set to automatically close itself when empty.

When undefined, and unnamed queue is created with no values. This is the only unnamed queue that will not automatically close itself when empty.

``qType`` is either a constructor function or left undefined. queue-flow does nothing to verify that the provided constructor function is valid, except checking that it is a ``Function`` object, so use this mechanism with care!

### ``q.async`` (or ``q.cps``) Helper Method

This method flags a given function as one that should receive an asynchronous method list (with a callback) and the API will then expect the results be returned via the callback rather than immediately.

{% highlight js %}
q.async(func) // returns: modified func
{% endhighlight %}

Any ``Function`` object will succeed on this method, but it is up to the developer to make sure his arguments list matches the one specified for the queue processor his function is being given to.

### ``q.isAsync`` Helper Method

This method performs the (fast-but-imperfect) guesswork on whether a provided method is asynchronous or not. First, it checks if the ``async`` property exists for the function, and then it checks if the argument length of the function matches the specified length an asynchronous function would have.

{% highlight js %}
q.isAsync(func, asyncArgLength) // returns: boolean
{% endhighlight %}

### ``q.ns`` Helper Method

This method takes no arguments, and returns a wholly-independent queue-flow namespace. Queue flows from one *cannot* interact with queue flows from another (without writing some bridge code manually). This is to allow methods to work with named queues that have generic, easy-to-follow names, like ``error`` or ``requests`` and not have to worry about collisions with the queue flows spawned by other functions that might want to use the same name.

### ``q.tuple`` Helper Method

This method takes a Javascript object and converts it into an array of tuples (two value arrays). Each tuple is a set of ``[key, value]`` pairs from the original object. This is useful if you wish to operate on each item in the object independently of one another.

{% highlight js %}
q.tuple(obj) // returns: array of tuples [[key1, value1], [key2, value2], ... ]
{% endhighlight %}

### ``Q`` Constructor

{% highlight js %}
new q.Q([nameOrArray], [qType])
{% endhighlight %}

Constructing the ``Q`` object directly is *not* recommended, because it is not aware of the "named queue" mechanism. It simply ignores any value that isn't an array and substitutes with an empty array, and any ``Q`` object created with a non-full array must be manually ``.close()``d. In all other respects it behaves identically to constructing the queue flow with ``q``.

### ``new Q().on`` Privileged Method

{% highlight js %}
q('someQueue').on(event, callbackFunction); // returns Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

There are 4 events in queue-flow: ``push``, ``pull``, ``close``, and ``empty``. All events except ``empty`` may be cancelled by returning ``false``. The method signatures of the callbacks for each event are as follows:

{% highlight js %}
{
        push: function(value) {},
        pull: function(value) {},
        close: function() {},
        empty: function() {}
}
{% endhighlight %}

The callbacks' ``this`` is bound to the ``Q`` instance they are called on, more than one callback may be registered for a given event, they will be run in the order they are registered, and execution of event handlers will cease the moment any callback returns false (even for ``empty``, but it won't cancel the event in any other way).

### ``new Q().fire`` Privileged Method

{% highlight js %}
q('someQueue').fire(event, some, other, variables); // Returns true or false
{% endhighlight %}

This is the mechanism by which events are fired, and meant primarily as a private method. It is exposed to allow the user to false-fire an event if they choose to do so (not recommeded), or for new prototypal methods to fire a new event invented for themselves (more understandable).

The first argument is a string to identify the event, and the remaining arguments are made the new arguments to each registered event handler.

### ``new Q().clear`` Privileged Method

{% highlight js %}
q('someQueue').clear('empty'); // returns Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

This method clears out all event handlers for a given event.

### ``new Q().setHandler`` Privileged Method

{% highlight js %}
q('someQueue').setHandler(handlerCallback); // returns Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

This method drains the queue and calls the given callback for each value. It is a very low-level queue processing function that is used internally by nearly all of the prototypal methods.

The ``handlerCallback`` signature is simply ``function(value, callback) { }`` where the ``callback`` takes no arguments and informs the queue to continue processing.

### ``new Q().push`` Privileged Method

This method pushes new values onto the queue. Each argument is a separate queue value.

### ``new Q().close`` Privileged Method

This method destroys the queue. If there is a registered mechanism for draining the queue, it waits until all remaining items in the queue have been drained, otherwise it destroys on the next run through the Javascript event loop.

### ``Q.prototype.as`` Method

{% highlight js %}
q([1, 2, 3]).as(name); // returns Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

This method take a string and registers the specific queue under that name. Queues may have more than one name.

### ``Q.prototype.closeOnEmpty`` Method

{% highlight js %}
q('name').closeOnEmpty(); // returns Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

This method registers an event handler for the ``empty`` event to close the queue. Mostly used internally but may have a few other use-cases.

### ``Q.prototype.load`` Method

{% highlight js %}
q('name').load(array); // returns Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

This method is syntactic sugar for loading an array of values for the queue on top of the ``push`` Privileged Method, since using ``.apply`` on ``push`` is awkward when the queue flow reference is a long name, and worse with an unnamed queue flow, which must be saved to a variable, first, otherwise.

### ``Q.prototype.each`` Method

{% highlight js %}
q([1,2,3]).each(eachCallback); // returns a new Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

This method performs an each operation, which can be seen as a specialization of map. The eachCallback is given a value from the queue one at a time, and the callback is expected to perform some sort of side-effect operation not affecting the queue flow in any way, as it simply creates a new queue and pushes the input values into the new output queue.

### ``Q.prototype.map`` Method

{% highlight js %}
q([1,2,3]).map(mapCallback); // returns a new Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

This method performs a map operation. Values from the first queue are pulled, manipulated by the given callback, and then pushed into a new, anonymous queue which is returned as a reference for the next method in the chain. If the upstream queue is closed, map will propagate that change to the queue it's been given.

There are two function signatures for the map callback:

{% highlight js %}
{
        sync: function(val) { return something; },
        async: function(val, callback) { callback(something); }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### ``Q.prototype.reduce`` Method

{% highlight js %}
q([1, 2, 3]).reduce(reduceCallback, finalCallback, initialCondition); // returns the original Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

This method performs a reduce operation. Values from the queue are pulled, manipulated by the first callback which has been given the previous value (or initialCondition), and when the queue closes, the results are passed to the final callback.

There are two function signatures for the first reduce callback:

{% highlight js %}
{
        sync: function(prev, val) { return something; },
        async: function(prev, val, callback) { callback(something); }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The second callback has just one signature:
{% highlight js %}
function(result) { /* Do whatever */ }
{% endhighlight %}

### ``Q.prototype.filter`` Method

{% highlight js %}
q([1, 2, 3]).filter(filterCallback); // returns a new Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

This method performs a filter operation. Values from the queue are pulled and passed to the filter callback. If the callback returns true, the value is passed on to the new anonymous queue, otherwise it is discarded.

There are two function signatures for the filter callback:

{% highlight js %}
{
        sync: function(val) { return true || false; },
        async: function(val, callback) { callback(true || false); }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### ``Q.prototype.branch`` Method

{% highlight js %}
q([1, 2, 3]).branch(branchCallback); // returns the original Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

This method performs the queue-flow-specific branch operation. Values from the queue are pulled and passed to the filter callback. The callback then returns the name of the queue the value should be inserted into.

There are two function signatures for the branch callback:

{% highlight js %}
{
        sync: function(val) { return 'queueName'; },
        async: function(val, callback) { callback('queueName'); }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### ``Q.prototype.every`` and ``Q.prototype.some`` Methods

These methods have the following signatures:

{% highlight js %}
q([1, 2, 3]).every(everyCallback, finalCallback); // returns original Q instance
q([1, 2, 3]).some(someCallback, finalCallback); // returns original Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

For both, the first callback, just like the first callback of the ``filter`` method, and must return a true or false. However, they are like ``reduce`` in that they return a singular value at the end. For ``every``, it passes ``true`` to the final callback *only if every* call to the first callback returns true, otherwise it short-circuits and returns false. For ``some`` is the opposite, it passes ``true`` to the final callback if it receives a single ``true`` from the first callback, otherwise it returns ``false`` after the entire array is parsed.

The first callback of both have the exact same signatures as the ``filter`` method's first callback.

### ``Q.prototype.toArray`` Method

{% highlight js %}
q([1, 2, 3]).toArray(callback); // returns original Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

This method drains the attached queue and constructs a "normal" array, which is then passed to the specified callback, which is the only argument. This callback has the following signature:

{% highlight js %}
function(array) { /* Do whatever */ }
{% endhighlight %}

### ``Q.prototype.flatten`` Method

{% highlight js %}
q([1, [2, [3]]]).flatten(depth); // returns new Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

This method takes an input queue, and "flattens" out any nested arrays, passing along their values to a new queue in the order found. An optional ``depth`` value can be specified to determine how many layers of arrays should be flattened out. This method is heavily inspired by the underscore.js method of the same name.

### ``Q.prototype.exec`` Method

{% highlight js %}
q([1, 2, 3]).exec(callback, onError, cbThis); // returns new Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

This method is a variant on `map` designed to fit in well with the Node.js APIs (and other Node.js libraries). Each input value is passed into the provided callback, just like `map`, but if the value is an array, instead the arguments of the callback are populated by the array values (with a callback attached to the end if the callback is declared asynchronous).

If the provided callback is synchronous, it is assumed that whatever is returned is a valid result, and whatever is thrown is an error. If the callback is asynchronous, it is assumed that the first argument is passed to its own callback is an error value and the second argument is the correct result.

`onError` is a "magic" variable that does one of 4 things depending on the type of value it is. If the variable is not defined (or is "falsy") then `exec` just ignores the bad result and continues on to the next one in the queue. If the variable is a `Function`, then it stops pulling values from the queue and calls the specified function. If it is a `string`, then it pushes the `error, value` combo into the named queue specified. If it is any other kind of "truthy" value, then `exec` stops execution right then and does nothing else.

### ``Q.prototype.chain`` Method

{% highlight js %}
q([1, 2, 3]).chain(queueName); // returns original Q instance
{% endhighlight %}

This method is a simple wrapper around ``branch`` that pushes the input values into the specified queue. Useful for chaining several sub-queues into one large queue (for legibility reasons).
